# fm

Implementation of ctr / cvr models using pytorch or numpy (from scratch).

## Setting up environment

We use [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to manage dependencies of repository.

Use poetry with version `2.1.1`.

```shell
$ poetry --version
Poetry (version 2.1.1)
```

Python version should be `3.11.x`.

```shell
$ python --version
Python 3.11.11
```

If python version is lower than `3.11`, try installing required version using `pyenv`.

Create virtual environment.

```shell
$ poetry env activate
```

If your global python version is not 3.11, run following command.

```shell
$ poetry env use python3.11
```

You can check virtual environment path info and its executable python path using following command.

```shell
$ poetry env info
```

After setting up python version, just run following command which will install all the required packages from `poetry.lock`.

```shell
$ poetry install
```

## Setting up git hook

Set up automatic linting using the following commands:
```shell
# This command will ensure linting runs automatically every time you commit code.
pre-commit install
```
